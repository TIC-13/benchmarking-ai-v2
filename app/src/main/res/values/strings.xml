    <string name="about_app_title">About the app</string>
    <string name="about_app_content">This app\'s main objective is to benchmark artificial intelligence models focused on computer vision on Android smartphones. It evaluates tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.</string>

    <string name="how_works_title">How the Benchmarks Work</string>
    <string name="how_works_gpu_title">GPU Benchmarking</string>
    <string name="how_works_gpu">GPU usage is monitored through specific system files: /sys/kernel/gpu/gpu_busy for Mali GPUs and /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/gpubusy for Adreno GPUs.</string>
    <string name="how_works_ram_title">RAM Benchmarking</string>
    <string name="how_works_ram">To measure RAM usage, the app uses the PSS (Proportional Set Size) value, which accounts for both the memory used solely by the process and the memory shared with other processes, but only in proportion to the number of processes using it.</string>
    <string name="how_works_cpu_title">Why doesn\'t the app measure CPU usage?</string>
    <string name="how_works_cpu">Since Android 8.0, the operating system has restricted access to the /proc file during the app\'s runtime. This file was used, among other things, to obtain the CPU usage percentage. Due to these restrictions, it is not possible to capture the CPU usage percentage in the release version of the app, only in the debug version.</string>

Then, move the custom models to the Speed.AI folder in the phone\'s file system.\n\nIf you don\'t allow the access, you will still be able to continue with the default models.</string>
